# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 1 - Task 12 - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Description
This task was my introduction to OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Javascript. I needed to create an array of objects. Each object contains the details of a car (make, model, colour, price etc). The website needed to pull the data from this array and display the vehicle information in an attractive way on the page.

## Instructions
These were the instructions I was given to guide me:

**Compulsory task 1**
Follow these steps:
* Create a file called cars.html. You are going to create a webpage for a car salesman. The page will display details about cars that are for sale. Create whatever HTML you deem appropriate for this task and style the page as you like. However, be sure that the information about the cars for sale are displayed on the webpage programmatically (see the next point) - not hard coded with HTML.
* Create a file cars.js. Within cars.js:
    Create 5 car objects using a constructor function.
        * Each car object should have the following properties: make, model, colour, image, registration number, price.
        * Each car object should also include a showMore() method. This method should display a dialogue that displays all the details about the specific car object. Hint: See more about <dialog> here.
        * Create a function that will be used to display the make, model and image of each car object in ‘cars.html’ when ‘cars.html’ is loaded.
* Whenever a user clicks on an image of a car, the showMore() method should be called and all the information about the car, including the registration number, price etc should be displayed.
